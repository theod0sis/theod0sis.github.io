		"bio": "I am a software engineer with a passion for coding. My tech stack includes Java and Javascript but I love learning new skills and programming languages. In my current work, I mostly use Java Spring but for personal projects, I try other technologies like node.js and express.js. I believe blockchain will change how things work on the internet right now so I decided to learn more about how it works and I got a Blockchain Developer nanodegree from Udacity. I mostly know backend technologies but I always check what new things for frontend are out and I try them on personal projects.\n",
